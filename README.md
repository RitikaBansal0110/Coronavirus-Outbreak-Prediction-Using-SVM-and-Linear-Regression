Corona virus Outbreak Prediction Using Machine Learning Algorithms such as Support Vector Machine(SVM) and Linear Regression.

Coronavirus (Covid-19) has become the most buzzed topic these days. Its outbreak has taken the world by storm. 
In this we have analysed the outbreak of coronavirus from various regions, visualized them using different charts and graphs and also predicted number of upcoming cases for next few days using Machine Learning Algorithms like Linear Regression and Support Vector Machine(SVM) model in python.

The dataset is taken from kaggle and are in the form of .csv files. There are three datasets confirmed, deaths, recovered.

The dataset is provided by Johns Hopkins University

This dataset has daily level information on the number of affected cases, deaths and recovery from 2019 novel coronavirus. Please note that this is a time series data and so the number of cases on any given day is the cumulative number.

The data is available from 22 Jan, 2020.

# About Coronavirus
On 31 December 2019, WHO was alerted to several cases of pneumonia in Wuhan City, Hubei Province of China. The virus did not match any other known virus. This raised concern because when a virus is new, we do not know how it affects people.

2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a virus (more specifically, a coronavirus) identified as the cause of an outbreak of respiratory illness first detected in Wuhan, China. Early on, many of the patients in the outbreak in Wuhan, China reportedly had some link to a large seafood and animal market, suggesting animal-to-person spread. However, a growing number of patients reportedly have not had exposure to animal markets, indicating person-to-person spread is occurring. At this time, itâ€™s unclear how easily or sustainably this virus is spreading between people. Precautionary measures according to WHO are mentioned below:

1.Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. 

2.Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and others. Why? When someone coughs, sneezes, or speaks they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus.

3.Avoid going to crowded places.

4.Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth.

5.Stay home and self-isolate even with minor symptoms such as cough, headache, mild fever, until you recover.
