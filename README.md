# Coronavirus-Outbreak-Prediction-Using-SVM-and-Linear-Regression
Corona virus Outbreak Prediction Using Machine Learning Algorithms such as Support Vector Machine(SVM) and Linear Regression.

Coronavirus (Covid-19) has become the most buzzed topic these days. Its outbreak has taken the world by storm. 
In this we have analysed the outbreak of coronavirus from various reigons,visualized them using different charts and graphs and also predicted number of upcoming cases for next few days using Machine Learning Algorithms like Linear Regression and Support Vector Machine(SVM) model in python.

The dataset is taken from kaggle and are in the form of .csv files. There are three datasets confirmed, deaths, recovered.

# Safety Measures from Coronavirus
1.Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. 

2.Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and others. Why? When someone coughs, sneezes, or speaks they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus.

3.Avoid going to crowded places.

4.Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth.

5.Stay home and self-isolate even with minor symptoms such as cough, headache, mild fever, until you recover.
